## Packages

This repository is a monorepo managed with [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev), containing the following packages:

| Package | Description | Pub |
|---|---|---|
| [dartpollo](packages/dartpollo/) | GraphQL client with caching support | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/dartpollo.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/dartpollo) |
| [dartpollo_generator](packages/dartpollo_generator/) | Code generator that builds Dart types from GraphQL schemas | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/dartpollo_generator.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/dartpollo_generator) |
| [dartpollo_annotation](packages/dartpollo_annotation/) | Shared types and annotations used by both client and generator | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/dartpollo_annotation.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/dartpollo_annotation) |

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add the client as a dependency and the generator as a dev dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dartpollo: ^0.1.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.10.0
  dartpollo_generator: ^0.1.0
```

> **Note:** `dartpollo_annotation` is automatically included as a transitive dependency — you don't need to add it manually.

### Setup

1. **Define your GraphQL schema** (e.g., `schema.graphql`)

2. **Create a `build.yaml`** in your project root:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    sources:
      - $package$
      - lib/**
      - schema.graphql
    builders:
      dartpollo_generator|dartpollo:
        options:
          schema_mapping:
            - schema: schema.graphql
              queries_glob: lib/**/*.graphql
```

3. **Write your GraphQL queries** as `.graphql` files in `lib/`

4. **Run the code generator:**

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

5. **Use the generated types with the client:**

```dart
import 'package:dartpollo/dartpollo.dart';

final client = DartpolloClient(link: yourLink);
final response = await client.execute(YourGeneratedQuery());
```
